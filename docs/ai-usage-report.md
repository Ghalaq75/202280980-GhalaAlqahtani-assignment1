#### Creative Inspiration
- **Design Ideas**: AI provided creative suggestions for the "como" theme color palette
- **Feature Suggestions**: Proposed interactive features like time-based greeting and scroll animations
- **Layout Options**: Offered multiple approaches to responsive design problems

### Challenges

#### Learning Curve
- **Initial Setup**: Took time to learn how to effectively prompt AI for desired results
- **Understanding Output**: Sometimes AI-generated code required research to fully understand
- **Context Limitations**: Had to break down complex requests into smaller, manageable parts

#### Over-Reliance Risk

## 4. Responsible Use & Modifications

### Code Review Process

#### 1. Initial Generation
- Used AI to generate foundational code structure
- Requested explanations for complex sections
- Asked for code comments during generation

#### 2. Understanding Phase
For each AI-generated section, I:
- Read through the entire code carefully
- Looked up unfamiliar functions or properties
- Tested each feature individually
- Compared with examples from official documentation

#### 3. Customization & Modification

**Example 1: Theme Colors**
- **AI Generated**: Generic blue theme
- **My Modification**: Changed to custom Como theme with muted greens and earthy tones

**Example 2: Greeting Function**
- **AI Generated**: Simple time-based greeting
- **My Modification**: Added emoji and more personality
```javascript
// Added emojis for visual interest
if (currentHour < 12) {
    greeting = 'Good Morning! ☀️';
}
```

**Example 3: Form Handling**
- **AI Generated**: Basic form submission
- **My Modification**: Added success message with timeout and animation
```javascript
// Enhanced with visual feedback and auto-hide
setTimeout(() => {
    successMessage.classList.remove('show');
}, 5000);
```

### Quality Assurance

#### Testing Protocol
1. **Browser Testing**: Tested in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
2. **Device Testing**: Verified on desktop, tablet.
3. **Feature Testing**: Ensured all interactive elements worked properly
4. **Performance Testing**: Checked load times and animation smoothness

### Originality Measures

#### Personal Touches
1. **Content Creation**: All text content is personally written
2. **Design Choices**: Selected "como" theme based on personal aesthetic preference
3. **Feature Selection**: Chose which interactive features to include
4. **Layout Decisions**: Made final decisions on spacing, sizing, and organization
